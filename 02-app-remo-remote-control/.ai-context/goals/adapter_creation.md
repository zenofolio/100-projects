# Adapter Creation Goal

## Goal: Create a new device adapter (e.g., MockAdapter) for Remo Remote Control

### Steps
1. Create a new folder in `lib/application/data/adapters/<adapter_name>/`.
2. Implement a class extending `DeviceAdapter` and all required methods (`configure`, `connect`, `disconnect`, `isConnected`).
3. Add all relevant capabilities using the provided mixins and capability classes.
4. If needed, implement communication helpers (e.g., sockets, HTTP clients).
5. Add a static `factory` method for easy instantiation.
6. Write unit and widget tests in `test/` to ensure all adapter features work as expected.
7. Document the adapter's features and limitations in `.ai-context/knowledge/`.

---

## Acceptance Criteria
- The adapter must not throw errors in any method.
- All capabilities should be testable and return successful results.
- The adapter should be easily swappable for real adapters in the app.

# Goal: Standardize Adapter Creation from Official Documentation

## Objective
Automate and document the process of generating all required `.ai-context` files (rules, goals, knowledge, API references, templates) for a new device adapter, using official protocol documentation as the source of truth.

## Steps
1. **Gather Official Documentation**
   - Locate and review the official protocol/API documentation for the target device (e.g., Samsung, LG, Sony).
   - Extract connection details, message formats, supported commands, and authentication requirements.

2. **Create Knowledge Base**
   - Summarize the protocol, connection method, and key technical details in `.ai-context/knowledge/<device>_protocol.md`.

3. **Define API Reference**
   - Create a structured API/protocol reference in `.ai-context/api/<device>_remote.json` (or similar), including message formats and command lists.

4. **Write Adapter Implementation Rules**
   - Update `.ai-context/rules.md` with clear, English instructions for implementing the adapter, referencing the new knowledge and API files.

5. **Draft a Step-by-Step Goal**
   - Add a new goal in `.ai-context/goals/adapter_creation_from_doc.md` outlining the process for future adapters.

6. **Provide Templates**
   - Add or update code templates in `.ai-context/templates/` to match the new adapterâ€™s requirements.

7. **Review and Iterate**
   - Ensure all documentation is clear, up-to-date, and references the official source.

## Acceptance Criteria
- All `.ai-context` files for the new adapter are generated and reference the official documentation.
- The process is repeatable for any new device/brand.
- Developers can follow the generated plan to implement and test a new adapter efficiently.

# 🚀 Zenozaga 100 Projects Challenge

Welcome to my **100 Projects Challenge**, where I'm building **100 small but meaningful projects** to sharpen my skills, explore new technologies, and share my journey as a developer.

Each project will focus on different concepts — from frontend and backend basics to real-time apps, APIs, automation tools, and more. The complexity will **gradually increase** as the challenge progresses.

---

## 🧠 Goals

- Practice and improve daily coding habits  
- Explore modern tools and frameworks  
- Build a solid developer portfolio  
- Share everything in public to help others learn
